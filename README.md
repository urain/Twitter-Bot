# Twitter-Bot
This is a simple Twitter Bot which will search out a particular Hashtag and database the results found. It then has the ability to modify the text to your specifications or simply append a url of interest to the tweet. Simplistic modification also takes place to defeat pattern matching algorithms which may flag the tweet as spam before being re-tweeted. The bot relies on chatterbot.
